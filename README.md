# ellipse_homotopy
Tools for experimentally exploring the homotopy type of Vietoris-Rips complexes generated from ellipses. 

## ellipse_tools: 
misc collection of tools for working with the ellipse

## ripser_ellipse:
script for generating persistance diagram of ellipse

## wf_ellipse:
script for comparing semi-major axis of ellipse a and the smallest r value such that the Vietoris-Rips complex of the ellipse at distance r includes a five vertex clique, i.e. k_5

## computational_library:
library for wf_ellipse written in C for performance reasons
